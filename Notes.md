how it will work:

user types splice_soundpacks 

a list of soundpacks are shown

the user can then select a soundpack

a soundpack has a name, an artist, and files inside it. 

the user can ask for the name, the artist and to see the files inside it 

if the user wants to see the files they can, and they can see key, tempo etc information about each file, as well as a url link to the file
